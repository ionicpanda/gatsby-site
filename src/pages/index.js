    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a computer science student at the University of Central Missouri.
       I strive to learn as much as I can about programming and computer security. When I'm not studying computer science, I can be found playing the french horn in my University's orchestra. 
I believe that balancing my life between mathematics and music allows me to strenghten both hemispheres of my brain. I've spent a few years working in the infosec community and now I strive on becoming a software engineer who utilizes secure coding paradigms.</p>
